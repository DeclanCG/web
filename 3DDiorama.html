        <h2> Introduction of unit</h2>
        <p>
            Within our second product unit, we were tasked to create a 3D model diorama of: an Island, Dungeon room or
            anything of your liking within Maya.
            We had to go through different plan elements like mind maps, the different assets we were going to use and
            many more
        </p>

        <h2> Conclusion </h2>
        <p>
            How I went through the thought process and creation of my Island was by taking a look through the different
            Ideas I could use.
            Now I'm not very good at 3D modeling but I had stuck with the eaiser option to create a 3D model Island as
            it would be a cool intake on what my
            island would look like compared to others who have created theirs in the past. So once I had gotten my ideas
            into play with my Island I started off
            making different Ideas on what the assets should look like leaving me with; some grass, a chest and lastly a
            huge rock. With the colour schemes
            had made the sand a whiter yellow as it reflects sand in differnt parts of the world and the grass being a
            plain green. For the texturing of my chest
            and huge rock, With the chest I made a lighter wood orentation for the wooden parts of the model and a rough
            grey texture for the metal outline. While
            trying to organise where things go on the island I had chose to create a small lake within island close to
            the ocean that would surround the Island.
