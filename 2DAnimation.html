        <h2> Introduction of unit</h2>
        <p>
            In our major last unit we were tasked with creating a 2D animation using adobe animate. Within this
            assessment
            we were told to create a hand drawn animation that goes on for my than 30 seconds and that the animation has
            an
            audio feauture to it. Along the way I was tasked to think about the art style I was going to use the theme
            of
            the animation and lastly how the animation flows together.

        <h2> Conclusion </h2>
        <p>
            Within my Animation, I only had a short period of time to create this in (2 weeks roughly). But none the
            less
            I started off with my planning originaly having the idea of a lake creature attacking a fisherman but
            changing
            the idea to this. The whole idea behind "Portal" was heavily inspired by God of War 2018 as I had played the
            game
            and thought about the fast travel door system. With my planning I had looked into some norse mythology and
            the
            different realms, I had done some reasearch into the origin of old norse writing and found a template of
            their
            alphabet which I copied to make some words in norse. Further onto the animation I had cut out some of the
            assets I
            was going to use like the huge symbol on the island and the symbol on the door as time was short. But none
            the less
            I continued on the plan of making my character open up on the ocean traveling to the main island, traversing
            through
            the dark cave to finish up with braking the locks on the portal door and traveling to the next area. I had
            thought
            about the different colours to use as keeping the island a variety of grey's for the texture of rock and the
            sand
            a certain yellow colour. As for the character I tried sticking to the reference image and using the type of
            colours
            shown there, but for the boat, I had tried different versions of brown, lighter and darker to create a
            contrast on
            the character and the waterline.
