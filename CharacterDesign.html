        <h2> Introduction of unit</h2>
        <p>
            In the third unit of study, we were to create our very own character, exploring different art styles. The
            process behind our own character creation
            was to do some reasearch on pre-existing characters or themes and base your own from there taking small bits
            of inspiration from other creators.
            One of the major aspects of our character we had to consider is the colour scheme and palate we were using.

        <h2> Conclusion </h2>
        <p>
            The approach I had taken when creating my character was the period of time he was from. I already knew what
            I wanted to create as I play alot
            of shooting games (Call of Duty) and wanted to create a soldier in war time. I had to think if he was from
            present, future or past
            and originally thought of using the past but I was warned that this kind of character has been created over
            and over again as a WW Soldier. So I had
            to improvise to create the solider futureistic. After I had created the kind of character I wanted to create
            I had started on the background as he would
            of been in a futuristic city with some old buildings standing from 2010's (The time is set around 2040 were
            technolgy has advanced). When going through
            colour design I had picked 4 different colours 2 primary and 2 secondary, the primary being Blue and Green
            while the second colours being mustard yellow
            and red. I played around with different tones of the primary colours as to mix and match the flavours of the
            colour. I had some feedback given to me saying
            the yellow and green looked a bit like the Mandolorian from Star wars so I tried adapting both colour
            palates together to create something completly different
            and unqie. Having limted skill I had a small bit of help with creating rough sketches as I was given a few
            lines to follow I had went off my own path
            away from block building to lines roughing around everywhere to find a different view on the character.
            Eventuraly I found the rough sketches to complex
            to replecate into a final form. So I dumbed it down to a simplier version and had used him in my final
            piece.
